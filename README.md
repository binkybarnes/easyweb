EasyWeb is an open platform for building and serving AI agents that interact with web browsers.

**Using a web agent has never been easier:** Just open EasyWeb's interface, enter your command, and watch the agent take care of your browser-related tasks, whether it be travel planning, online shopping, news gathering, or anything you can think of.

**Deploy once, use everywhere:** EasyWeb comes with a full package for deploying web agents as a service. Built on [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands), EasyWeb introduces a parallelized architecture capable of fulfilling multiple user requests simultaneously, and supports toggling your favorite agent and LLM available as APIs.

## News
- [2025/01] We released **ReasonerAgent: A Training-Free UI Agent That Exceeds GPT-4o-Based Agents by Up to 124%**. Check out the blog [post](about:blank)

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements


* Linux, Mac OS, or [WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (For those on MacOS, make sure to allow the default Docker socket to be used from advanced settings!)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) = 3.11
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) >= 18.17.1
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) = 1.8.4

Make sure you have all these dependencies installed before moving on to `make build`.

<details>
<summary><b>Expand for setup without sudo access</b></summary>

If you want to develop without system admin/sudo access to upgrade/install `Python` and/or `NodeJs`, you can use `conda` or `mamba` to manage the packages for you:

```bash
# Download and install Mamba (a faster version of conda)
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh

# Install Python 3.11, nodejs, and poetry
mamba install python=3.11
mamba install conda-forge::nodejs
mamba install conda-forge::poetry=1.8.4
```

</details>



### 2. Build and Setup The Environment

Begin by building the project, which includes setting up the environment and installing dependencies.

```bash
make build
```

### 3. Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, launching EasyWeb is as simple as running a single command. This command starts both the backend and frontend servers seamlessly.

```bash
make run
```

### 4. Individual Server Startup and Scaling Service

<details>
<summary><b>Expand to see details for scaling service</b></summary>

- **Start the Backend Server:** If you prefer, you can start the backend server independently to focus on backend-related tasks or configurations.
    ```bash
    make start-backend
    ```
- **Start the Frontend Server:** Similarly, you can start the frontend server on its own to work on frontend-related components or interface enhancements.
    ```bash
    make start-frontend
    ```
- **Start Multiple Backend Servers** If you prefer, you can also start multiple backend servers together with ports $5000$ and onwards for running multiple requests (one request per backend), given that you have sufficient memory on the machine.
    ```bash
    make start-backends NUM_BACKENDS={number_of_your_choice} START_PORT=5000
    ```
    Once you started multiple backend port, please start the frontend using:
    ```bash
    poetry run python frontend.py --num-backends {num_backend_opened}
    ```
    Then you can duplicate the frontend link you just opened to start running parallel requests.

    We aim to support a more scalable approach to multiple backends going forward.
